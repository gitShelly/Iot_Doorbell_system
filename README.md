## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

• To design and implement an IoT-based automatic doorbell ringing system.

• To enhance home security and convenience by detecting human presence at the entrance.

• To integrate sensors, microcontrollers, and IoT platforms for system operation.



## Need Analysis

The need for an automatic doorbell ringing system arises from the following factors:

• Ensuring home security by detecting the presence of individuals at the door.

• Providing convenience to homeowners by automating the doorbell.

• Integrating modern IoT technologies for real-time monitoring.



## Working Approach

Our project follows a comprehensive working approach, which includes the following steps:


### System Design:

• Identify the components and sensors needed for human presence detection.

• Design the hardware architecture of the doorbell system.

• Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of humans, buzzer to act as the bell and an LED to tell whether the circuit is on.

• The Arduino board plays a crucial role in this project. It serves as the microcontroller and the central processing unit for your project


### Hardware Implementation:

• Assemble the hardware components, including motion sensors and microcontrollers.

• Use bread board and jumper wires to make the necessary circuit connections.


### Software Development:

• Write the code for sensor data collection and analysis.

• Implement the logic for automatic doorbell activation.


### IoT Integration:

• Connect the doorbell system to an IoT platform for remote monitoring.

• Set up data transmission protocols for real-time alerts.



### Testing and Validation:

• Test the system for human presence detection.

• Validate the automatic doorbell functionality.


## Results

#### Detection Accuracy: 

The UV sensor demonstrated accurate human presence detection. When a person was within its sensing range, the system consistently activated the doorbell.


#### Real-Time Responsiveness: 
The project exhibited real-time responsiveness. Upon detecting a person, the doorbell rang promptly, making it suitable for its intended application
